## CONCEPT

It was unheard of for vaccines or any other medicines for that matter to go from a factory in one corner of the world to your local pharmacy in less than 2 years. But because of the covid pandemic over the past 36 months, this is exactly what occurred.

Unfortunately, the rush to deliver vaccines and medicines around the world has also created plentiful opportunities for counterfeit drug manufacturers to make a quick buck. 

On a broader scale, The World Health Organization estimates that up to 1% of medicines available in the developed world are likely to be counterfeit. 1% of the medicine market is a lot, and potentially affects hundreds of thousands of lives. In the developing world though, this number can go upto 50%! Imagine having to bet on your life-saving medicine to be authentic and not fake!
